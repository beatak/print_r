JavaScript implementation of PHP's favorite function print_r()

example:
========

var print_r = require('print_r').print_r;

var a = {
  foo: 1,
  bar: function () {return 'hi';}
};

console.log(print_r(a));
//(object){
//    foo:(number)1,
//    bar:(function)function () {return 'hi';}}

todo:
=====

* the way it handles array seems to be wrong.
* write test.
* tag the version.
* is there a way to export functions into global easily?
* is it better to spit to console.log() defaultly as in PHP?
